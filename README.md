# EEC 289Q Modeling and Optimization Project
Reproducing results of [Exact and Approximate Algorithms for the Optimization of Area and Delay in Multiple Constant Multiplications](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3226089_Exact_and_Approximate_Algorithms_for_the_Optimization_of_Area_and_Delay_in_Multiple_Constant_Multiplications)

## Setup
package management for this project is done via
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To instantiate the virtual environment run:
```
uv sync
```
